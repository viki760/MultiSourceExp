# Multi-source Experiment (Set 1)

Playground for doing multi source transfer experiments & attempting to write “good” codes.

**formula_tast/:** for g calculation (instead of and in comparison to training together with f) with fixed f

**alpha_calculation/:** for deriving alpha through convex optimization w/ & w/o regularization and output analysis

Considering the unstable status of wsl on my computer, all files with acceptable size are included for backup :)
